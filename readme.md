###Labels

To include the datasets' coded value text labels in your analysis, include a csv file in the specific datasets' directory called *labels.csv*, and give it the following column/header structure: variable, code, label

#Summary

This package expects you to read in the data yourself, as needed, **and merge the replicate weights**. The [demo](http://tinyurl.com/han46ya) has good examples for quickly doing this.

See the [demo](http://tinyurl.com/han46ya) to see how you can develop complex and interactive tables, charts, and maps using data from the largest household travel survey in the United States.
