###Labels

This package already includes verified text labels for the supported datasets, included as *data/year/labels.csv*. If you wish to create your own coded value text labels/descriptions for your analysis, you can copy and revise one of the included *labels.csv*, keeping the same structure.

#Summary

This package expects you to read in the data yourself, as needed, **and merge the replicate weights**. The [demo](http://tinyurl.com/han46ya) has good examples for quickly doing this.

See the [demo](http://tinyurl.com/han46ya) to see how you can develop complex and interactive tables, charts, and maps using data from the largest household travel survey in the United States.
